TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

Problem: "Could not resolve CoreCLR path" error
Solution:
- This means .NET runtime is missing or not embedded
- Use the self-contained version (90-120MB file size)
- Or install .NET 8.0 Desktop Runtime from Microsoft
- See DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md for detailed solutions

Problem: Screensaver won't start
Solution: 
- Make sure file has .scr extension or use /s flag
- Check Windows Event Viewer for errors
- Check log: C:\Windows\Temp\rss_viz.log

Problem: No articles showing
Solution:
- Check internet connection
- Verify feed URLs are valid and accessible
- Check log file for feed errors
- Try restoring default feeds in Settings

Problem: Word cloud shows unwanted words
Solution:
- Open Settings → Word Cloud
- Add words to exclude list
- Save and restart screensaver

Problem: Performance is slow
Solution:
- Reduce items per feed (try 10 instead of 24)
- Increase refresh interval to 30+ minutes
- Lower animation speed to 0.5
- Remove slow/unreliable feeds


REQUIREMENTS
------------

- Windows 10 or Windows 11 (64-bit)
- WebView2 Runtime (pre-installed on most systems)
- Internet connection
- Approximately 100MB disk space

IMPORTANT: If using the self-contained version (recommended), 
no additional .NET installation is required. The file size 
should be 90-120MB. Smaller files may require .NET 8.0 
Desktop Runtime to be installed separately.
